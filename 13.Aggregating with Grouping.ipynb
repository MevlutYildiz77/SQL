    "# GROUP BY Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "**The GROUP BY clause groups the rows into summary rows. It returns one value for each group and is typically used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG).\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT column_1, aggregate_function(column_2)\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "GROUP BY column_1;\n",
    "\n",
    "**In case a WHERE clause is used, the GROUP BY clause should come after the WHERE clause.** We specify the column or a list of **comma-separated columns right after the GROUP BY.**  Any nonaggregate expression in the SELECT must be included in the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips: \n",
    "GROUP BY returns only one result per group of data.\n",
    "GROUP BY Clause always follows the WHERE Clause.\n",
    "GROUP BY Clause always precedes the ORDER BY.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT gender, COUNT(gender)\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "GROUP BY gender;\n",

    "Female      4            \n",
    "Male        6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: The GROUP BY clause groups results before calling the aggregate function. This allows you to apply aggregate function to groups than the entire query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "**Tips:\n",
    "WHERE clause operates on the data before the aggregation.\n",
    "WHERE clause happens before the GROUP BY clause. \n",
