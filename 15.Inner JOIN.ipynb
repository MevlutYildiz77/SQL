    "It creates a new **result table based on the values in common columns from two or more tables.** INNER JOIN returns a table that **contains only matched rows** that meet the specified join conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT columns\n",
    "  FROM table_A\n",
    "  INNER JOIN table_B ON join_conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**columns: Column names from table_A or table_B.\n",
    "table_A, table_B: The names of the joined tables.\n",
    "join_conditions: It specifies the conditions to evaluate for each pair of joined rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A **join condition** generally takes the following form: **table_A.column = table_B.column.** The operator in this statement is **usually an equal sign (=), but **any comparison operator can also be used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:\n",
    "Note the ON keyword for specifying the INNER JOIN condition.\n",
    "Multiple join conditions can be written using AND or OR statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: three or more tables can be combined using the INNER JOIN clause.\n",

    "**Q: What is inner join?\n",
    "A: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The intersection of the two tables represents the matching rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both \"employees\" and \"departments\" tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the \"employees\" table that do not have matches in \"departments\", these records are not shown in the output.\n",
